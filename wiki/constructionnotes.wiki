There's not much to it. The parts are:
  * One mbed processor (http://mbed.org)
  * One serial camera module (http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=45&products_id=369)
  * Three servos (http://servoshop.co.uk/index.php?pid=STECENERG&area=Servo)
  * One switch for the power supply
  * One 4-AA-cell battery box

Servos wire directly to PWM pins on the mbed. The camera wires to UART pins on the mbed. The mbed also provides a 3.3v supply to run the camera.
