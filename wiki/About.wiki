==The Eyes project is a Bristol Dorkbot effort at collaborating electronics software and animatronics into an interactive art installation.==

The expected form is a matrix of moving people following eyes. Early expectations are that it will incorporate the following components...

1 - a camera to take images of people or objects
2 - an mbed ucontroller to process the images from the camera
3 - a hardware interface to the actuation of the eyes
4 - a number of independently moving animatronic eyes
