==============================

R - run mbed off the servo battery supply
R - add acceleration/deceleration to motion control
R - fix camera reset handling so it recovers after the mbed is reset
R - use interrupt-driven serial lib when available (or write a timer-based one) and then increase the camera baud rate

B - de-speckle
B - blob detect
B - motion detect

More motion detection cleverness if it is required
