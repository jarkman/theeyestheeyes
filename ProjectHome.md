The Eyes project is a Bristol Dorkbot effort at collaborating electronics software and animatronics into an interactive art installation. Through using simple electronics, code, mechanics and slight artistic license we have created a functioning motion tracking eye ball housed in a steam punk themed box. The eye rotates on 2 axis along with a moving eye lid. Using simple behavioural mechanisms such as boredom and sleepyness, the eye portrays life like characteristics. The completed first design can be seen below where it has been on display at Bristol Arnolfini's Uncraftivism event Dec 09.
